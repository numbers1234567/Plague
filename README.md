# Plague

The four heroes have been detected by Grand Inquisitor Vitalis! His army of rats is now flooding the cathedral and devouring everyone inside. These rats are well-coordinated, with a complex underground tunnel system, and will always flood each area of the cathedral in the minimum possible amount of time. 

Your task is to guide the heroes to the nearest exit.
