# Plague

The four heroes have been detected by Grand Inquisitor Vitalis! His army of rats is now flooding the cathedral and devouring everyone inside. These rats are well-coordinated, with a complex underground tunnel system, and will always flood the cathedral in a specific, pre-computed way.

Your task is to guide the heroes to Vitalis's lair to destroy him.
